The switch component allows users to toggle a control between two states.
The default state of the component is off, or `false`, however you can change the state by setting the `checked` property to a boolean value.
To handle the state change event you can use the `checkedChange` property, which notifies the app when the value has changed.
Another useful feature of the component is the `isEnable` property, which gives the functionality to make the component inactive.
